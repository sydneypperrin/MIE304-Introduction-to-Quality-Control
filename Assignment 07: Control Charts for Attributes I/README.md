# Assignment 07: Control Charts for Attributes I

Answer the following questions about dataset ’07 data’ using Python.

The following questions are about ‘insurance_nonc’ column.

1. The dataset contains data on examination of medical insurance claims. Every day 50 claims were examined. Set up the fraction nonconforming control chart for this process. Is the process in statistical control?

2. What center line and control limits should be used for process monitoring in the next period?

3. What are the center line and control limits in an np-chart for the process?

The following questions are about the rest of the columns.

4. The commercial loan operation of a financial institution has a standard for processing new loan applications in 24 hours. The dataset shows the number of applications processed each day for the last 20 days and the number of applications that required more than 24 hours to complete. Using a variable-width control limit approach, what is the initial center line?

5. Using the variable-width control chart from last question, is the process in control?

6. What is the center line that can be used in a chart for monitoring in next period?

Questions 7-9 assume we start from the previous solution.

7. What is the average sample size?

8. Starting with the original data, set up the fraction nonconforming control chart for this process using the average sample size control limit approach. Is the process in statistical control according to this chart?

9. What are the center line and the control limits after taking out any out-of-bound point?

10. Starting again with the original data, use the standardized control chart approach. Is the process in statistical control?
