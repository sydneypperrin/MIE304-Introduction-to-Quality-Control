# Assignment 11: CUSUM Charts (n=1)

Answer the following questions about dataset ‘11 data’ using Python.

The following questions are about ‘Temperature’ column.

1. Eighty measurements of the temperature reading from a chemical process in °C are presented in the dataset. One measurement is taken every two minutes. The target value for the mean is 950. Set up MR and I charts. Is the process in control?

2. Based on the data and the control charts, what is the estimate of the process mean?

3. Based on the data and the control charts, what is the estimate of the process standard deviation?

4. Set up a tabular two-sided CUSUM chart for detecting a shift from  to  for this process, using standardized values h = 4.77 and k = 0.5. Does the process appear to be in- control? (Use the estimated values of  and ).

5. Considering the first point lying outside the control limits, what is the estimate of the shifted mean () for that sample?

6. Assume that the original value of the standard deviation () for the temperature reading is known to be 8. Develop CUSUM charts for mean and variance. What can we conclude about this process?
