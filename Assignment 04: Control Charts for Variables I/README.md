# Assignment 04: Control Charts for Variables I

Answer the following questions about dataset ‘04 data’ using Python.

1. A high-voltage power supply should have a nominal output voltage of 350 V. A sample of four units is selected each day and tested for process-control purposes. Set up X-bar and R charts on this process. Is the process in statistical control?

2. What is the estimate of the standard deviation?

3. Is there evidence to support the claim that voltage is normally distributed?

4. Supposing the process was out-of-control, and after deleting the points lying out of the bounds in the R chart, the new (in-control) R-bar is 0.56. What would be the new values for the UCL and LCL in the R chart?

5. Supposing the process was out-of-control, and after deleting the points lying out of the bounds in the R chart, the new (in-control) R-bar is 0.56. What would be the new values for the CL, UCL and LCL in the X-bar chart?

6. Assume that the process mean shifts to a value that is 1.5 times the value of sigma. What is the probability that we will still assume that the previous value of mean is the correct one?

7. What is the Average Run Length (ARL) for this process?

8. What should be the minimum sample size if we desire to detect this shift with a probability of at least 0.9?

9. Supposing that the 4 units are collected every hour, what is the ARL if we switch the sample size to the integer value defined in the previous question?

10. What is the ATS if we switch the sample size to the same integer value defined in the previousquestion?

11. What should be the minimum sample size if we wish to increase the time to signal to at least 2.8h?
