# Assignment 12: EWMA Chart

Answer the following questions about dataset ’12 data’ using Python.

1. Twenty individual observations on molecular weight taken hourly from a chemical process are presented in the dataset. Set up MR and I charts. Is the process in control?

2. Based on the data and the control charts, what is the estimate of the process mean?

3. Based on the data and the control charts, what is the estimate of the process standard deviation?

4. We wish to detect all the shifts of 1.0 𝜎 that may happen in this process with an EWMA control chart. What are the appropriate values of 𝜆 and L that will result in the lowest ARL?

5. Set up an EWMA control chart for the shifts of 1.0 𝜎 using the values of 𝜆 and L selected in the previous question. Assume that µ0 and 𝜎 are the values of mean and standard deviation found in the I-MR chart. Is the process in control now?

6. When was the shift of 1.0 𝜎 firstly detected in the EWMA chart?

7. Now we wish to detect a shift of 2.5 𝜎 in the process using the EWMA chart. What are the values of 𝜆 and L that will result in the lowest ARL?

8. Set up an EWMA control chart for the shifts of 2.5 𝜎 using the values of 𝜆 and L selected in the previous question. Assume that µ0 and 𝜎 are the values of mean and standard deviation found in the I-MR chart. Is the process in control now?

9. When was the shift of 2.5 𝜎 firstly detected in the EWMA chart?

10. Now suppose we wish to implement a Fast Initial Response (FIR) to the EWMA control chart for the shift of 1.0 𝜎. When is this shift firstly detected in the EWMA chart? Assume f = 0.5.
