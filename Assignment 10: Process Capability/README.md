# Assignment 10: Process Capability

Answer the following questions about dataset ‘10 data’ using Python.

1. A high-level voltage power supply should have a nominal output voltage of 350 V. A sample of four units is selected each day and tested for process control purposes. The data shown in the dataset give the difference between the observed reading on each unit and the nominal voltage times ten; that is, Vol_i= (observed voltage on unit i - 350)*10. Set up X-bar and R charts. Is the process in statistical control?

2. What is the estimate of the process mean?

3. What is the estimate of the process standard deviation?

4. What are the Natural Tolerance Limits for this process?

5. If the specifications are USL = 352V, LSL = 348V, what is the value of Cp?

6. Is the basic capability requirement met (i.e., is the process capable)? Explain.

7. What is the process fallout?

8. What is the value of CPK?

9. What is the best approximation of the process fallout if you calculate using CPK?

10. Is the process centred? Explain.

11. What is the value of CPM?
