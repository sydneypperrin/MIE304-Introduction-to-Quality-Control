# MIE304 Course Project

This project provides an opportunity to apply the concepts and methods in this course to a real-life situation to monitor a process of your choice for quality control. The project applies to all methods covered after reading week (control charts for attributes, process capability, CUSUM charts, EWMA chart, etc). Only Python may be used for the required computations. 

Must project must include:
1. A description of the process being monitored.
2. How the data was collected, processed, to set up the initial control charts.
3. How the process was monitored to detect out-of-control conditions.
4. How out-of-control conditions were detected, and the assignable cause identified, and recommendations for its removal.
5. Assuming the process is in Phase 2, perform a Process Capability Study.
