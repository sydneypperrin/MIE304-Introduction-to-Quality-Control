# Assignment 06: Control Charts for Variables III

Answer the following questions about dataset ’06 data’ using Python.

1. The uniformity of a silicon wafer following an etching process is determined by measuring the layer thickness at several locations and expressing uniformity as the range of the thicknesses. The uniformity determinations for 30 consecutive wafers processed through the etching tool are presented in the dataset. Is there evidence that uniformity is normally distributed?

2. Take the natural logarithm of the data to make it normally distributed (check to see if that’s true!). Construct a control chart for individuals and a moving range control chart for uniformity for the etching process using the transformed data. Is the process in statistical control?

3. What is the value of MR-bar?

4. What is the estimate of the standard deviation for this process? (for the normally distributed data).

5. What are the upper and lower control limits for the I-chart?

6. What is the estimate of the mean for this process? (for the normally distributed data).
