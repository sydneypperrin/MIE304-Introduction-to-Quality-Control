# Assignment 05: Control Charts for Variables II

Answer the following questions about dataset ’05 data’ using Python.

The following questions are about ‘Thickness’ column.

1. The thickness of a printed circuit board is an important quality parameter. Data on board thickness (in inches) are given in the dataset for 25 samples of three boards each. Set up X-bar and R control charts. Is the process in statistical control?

2. What is the new value of R-bar after deleting the points lying out of bounds?

3. Based on the R chart obtained in the previous question, what is the estimate value of the standard deviation for this process?

4. What are the new values for the CL, UCL and LCL in the X-bar chart when all the points lying out of bounds are excluded?

5. Now set up X-bar and S charts for this process. Is the process in statistical control?

6. After deleting the out-of-control points, what should be the upper and lower control limits for the S chart?

7. Based on the S chart obtained in the previous question, what is the estimate of the standard deviation for this process?

8. What are the upper and lower control limits for the in-control X-bar chart?

The following questions are about ‘Concentration’ column.

9. The concentration of the active ingredient in a liquid cleaner produced in a continuous chemical process is monitored by X-bar and S charts. A batch is taken as a rational subgroup. The sample sizes vary from batch to batch, with production ranging from four to eight but with six as the predominant sample size. The past 12 batches of output resulted in the data presented in the dataset. Set up X-bar and S charts for this process. Is it in statistical control?

10. What is the value of S-bar?

11. What is the estimate of the mean of this process?
