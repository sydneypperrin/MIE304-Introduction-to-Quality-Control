# Course Project

This project provides an opportunity to apply the concepts and methods in this course to a monitor a real process for quality control. This process applies to all methods covered after reading week (control charts for attributes, process capability, CUSUM charts, EWMA charts).

The project must include:
1. A description of the process being monitored,     
2. How the data was collected, processed, to set up the initial control charts
3. How the process was monitored to detect out-of-control conditions.
4. How out-of-control conditions were detected, and the assignable cause identified, and recommendations for its removal,   
5. Assuming the process is in Phase 2, perform a Process Capability Study.
